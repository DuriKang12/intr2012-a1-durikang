                <h1>Changes in housing prices in GTA</h1>
                <p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) housing market
                    has undergone dramatic fluctuations, reflecting the broader economic shifts and societal changes
                    that have shaped Canada's real estate landscape. From an initial slowdown in home sales during the
                    early lockdowns to an unprecedented surge in prices fueled by low interest rates, shifting buyer
                    preferences, and supply shortages, the market has continuously evolved in response to new
                    challenges.</p>
                <p>In the years that followed, aggressive interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada sought to cool down
                    an overheated housing sector, leading to significant price corrections in 2022 and 2023. However, as
                    economic conditions stabilized, the market showed signs of resilience, with renewed demand in late
                    2023 and early 2024, though affordability concerns remained a pressing issue for prospective buyers.
                </p>
                <p>This analysis explores the key housing price trends from 2020 to 2025, the driving forces behind
                    these changes—including government policies, economic conditions, and migration patterns—and
                    speculates on the future direction of the GTA housing market. Through data visualization, we aim to
                    highlight the areas where housing prices have risen or fallen and examine the broader implications
                    of these fluctuations for homebuyers, investors, and policymakers.</p>

                <br> 
                <p><strong>Early 2020:</strong> At the pandemic's outset, there was a brief slowdown in the
                    housing market due to economic uncertainties and lockdown measures.</p>
                <p><strong>Mid to Late 2020:</strong> Contrary to initial forecasts predicting a decline,
                    housing prices began to rise. Factors such as historically low interest rates, increased
                    household savings, and a desire for more spacious living environments due to remote work
                    contributed to this surge.</p>
                <p><strong>2021:</strong> The upward trajectory continued, with the Canadian Real Estate
                    Association's House Price Index recording a 26.6% increase by the end of the year—the
                    fastest annual pace on record.</p>
                <p><strong>2022:</strong> Prices peaked in February, followed by a decline as the Bank of Canada
                    initiated interest rate hikes in March to combat inflation. By September, the Greater
                    Toronto Area saw average detached home prices decrease by nearly $400,000 from their peak.
                </p>
                <p><strong>2023–2024:</strong> The market stabilized with modest price increases. However,
                    affordability remained a significant concern due to elevated interest rates and high home
                    prices.</p>

                </script>
                <p><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The Bank of Canada's reduction of interest rates to historic lows in
                    2020 spurred borrowing and increased demand. Subsequent rate hikes beginning in 2022 cooled the
                    market by increasing borrowing costs.</p>
                <p><strong>Supply and Demand Dynamics:</strong> A persistent housing shortage, exacerbated by
                    underbuilding in previous years and supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, intensified
                    competition among buyers, driving prices upward.</p>
                <p><strong>Migration Patterns:</strong> The pandemic prompted a shift as individuals sought larger
                    living spaces, leading to increased demand in suburban areas of the GTA.</p>
                <p><strong>Government Policies:</strong> Measures such as the federal government's two-year ban on 
                    foreign homebuyers, introduced in 2022 to curb speculation, impacted demand dynamics.

                <p><strong>Detached House:</strong> Between 2020 and 2025, the preference for detached homes declined from 60% to 38% as affordability became a major concern. Rising interest rates and high mortgage costs made it harder for buyers to afford large homes, pushing them towards smaller alternatives. Additionally, younger buyers preferred urban convenience over suburban space, further reducing demand for detached houses.</p>
                <p><strong>Townhouse:</strong> Townhouses saw an increase in preference from 20% to 32%, as they became the best alternative to expensive detached homes. Many first-time buyers and families sought townhouses for their balance of affordability, space, and proximity to urban areas. Improved transit access and suburban developments also contributed to the rising demand for townhouses.</p>
                <p><strong>Condo:</strong> Despite an initial decline in 2020 due to the pandemic-driven suburban shift, condo demand rebounded, rising from 20% to 30% by 2025. As more people returned to city life and office work, condos became appealing for their affordability and convenience. Additionally, investors and renters kept demand stable, making condos a strong long-term housing option.</p>

                <p><strong>2020-2021: Low Rates and Housing Boom</strong></p>                     
                    <p>The Bank of Canada cut interest rates to 0.25% to stimulate the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                        This made mortgages cheaper, leading to a surge in homebuying activity and skyrocketing housing prices. 
                        The demand for detached homes increased, as buyers sought more space due to remote work.</p>
                    
                        <p><strong>2022-2024: High Rates and Market Slowdown</strong></p>
                    <p>To combat rising inflation, the Bank of Canada aggressively raised interest rates from 3.25% to 4.75%, 
                    making mortgages significantly more expensive. Housing demand dropped, causing price corrections 
                    in several GTA regions. Many buyers were priced out of the market, leading to slower home sales and 
                    a shift toward more affordable housing options like condos and townhouses.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>2025: Expected Rate Cuts and Market Adjustment</strong></p>
                    <p>As inflation stabilizes, the Bank of Canada is expected to lower interest rates to 4.00%, 
                        improving mortgage affordability. This could increase homebuying activity, but prices may remain 
                        high due to ongoing supply shortages. The market is expected to gradually recover, with townhouses 
                        and condos remaining the most in-demand housing types.</p>

                <h3>Future Projection</h3>
                <p>The GTA housing market has demonstrated resilience amid the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    While price growth has moderated, affordability remains a pressing issue. 
                    Future market stability will hinge on balanced supply and demand, prudent monetary policies, 
                    and effective government interventions. Analysts anticipate modest price increases, with projections around 2.8% for 2025. 
                    While interest rate cuts are expected, affordability challenges may persist due to high home prices and 
                    potential economic uncertainties. Sustained affordability will depend on factors such as housing supply expansion, 
                    economic conditions, and government interventions. Addressing the supply-demand imbalance through increased construction 
                    and policy measures will be crucial.
